# Election_Analysis-

## Project Overview 
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the followig task to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. 

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast. 
2. Get a complete list of the candidates who recieved votes. 
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recieved.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote. 

### Resources 
-Data Source: [Election_Reulsts.csv](https://github.com/BrandonCodes95/Election_Analysis-/blob/de4ed3882032e4d29106c949d631573837d9be47/Resources/Election_results.csv). 

-Software" Python 3.10.1, Visual Studio Code 1.38.1

     - Diana DeGette
     - Raymon Anthony Doane
   
  3. The candidate results were:
     - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
     - Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
     - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

   ### Suggestions for further use 
      I could see this code being very useful for other purposes or elections acorss the county. Keeping the basic format in tact for the code we could plug in not only counties but cities as well as states. The analysis would still work the same which is the beauty of it because this would allow results in a much quicker time frame. 
      For example if we changed the counties to cities and decided to try for a state Governor election to get the winner and same break down we could. The same could go for a Presdential election, where we could change the counties to states and calculate each states popular vote to get a winner.
